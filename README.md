# firefly-wallet-esp32c3

A modern implementation of the Firefly hardware old wallet using ESP32-C3 microcontroller, mainly for self-building / learning purpose

## Key Differences from Original
- **Hardware**: XIAO ESP32-C3 instead of Arduino Nano
- **Communication**: Native BLE instead of nRF24L01+
- **Storage**: NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) instead of EEPROM
- **Memory**: 400KB RAM vs 2KB (Arduino Nano)

## Hardware Requirements
- XIAO ESP32-C3 development board
- 128x64 OLED display (I2C)
- Tactile button
- 10kÎ© resistor

## Attribution
Based on the original Firefly Wallet project (https://github.com/firefly/wallet).
Adapted for ESP32-C3 platform with modern BLE communication.
